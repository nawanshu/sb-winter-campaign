## Implement the winter campaign page using React.js.
## Project github project instructions
During project implementation, over engineerring and under engineering trade off kept in mind, as this project is small to showcase big things like store, but still I have kept few things for consideration in order to think deep and for the future of the app. Features which are addons as:

- Test cases setup and add a file to showcase where to write test case.
- We can use store, for that, Just added a empty folder where we can place our Reducers and Actions.
- React component should be granular focused, so that they can be used multiple times, However, We are using here once due application size. So have taken care between granularity, due to size constraint of the application.

## Supporting tools and technologies used
- React 16.7.0
- Jest 23.6.0
- Material UI 3.9.0 for Icons
- WebPack 4.19.1
- Create-React-App 2.1.3
- Styled-components 4.1.3

## Project Branching
- ###master branch: Final code with all the basic requirements implementation.
- ###audit-1 branch: Performace auditing improvement.
- ###addons branch: Addons features included like styled component, testing.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
